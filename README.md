<b>About Hunger: Null</b>
We are a student-led team looking to simplify the food service industry.

<b>Mission Statement:</b>
For the everyday person who wants to get food delivered, Hunger: NULL is an app that connects different food delivery services together, so you can easily view all available options without having to check multiple apps.

<b>Application Description:</b>
Our app will ideally connect all the different food delivery apps like Grubhub, Doordash, Postmates etc. in one app. This means that all the restaurants that deliver in your city will be easy to see and pick from. The app will also have basic searchability, filtering capabilities, and links to restaurant websites for more information.
