# Project Title

For the everyday person who wants to get food delivered, Hunger: NULL is an app that connects different food delivery services together, so you can easily view all available options without having to check multiple apps.

Our app will ideally connect all the different food delivery apps like Grubhub, Doordash, Postmates etc. in one app. This means that all the restaurants that deliver in your city will be easy to see and pick from. The app will also have basic searchability, filtering capabilities, and links to restaurant websites for more information.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository. In terminal, using npm, install:
def foo():
    if not bar:
        return True
        npm install ejs
npm install express
npm install jquery
npm install mocha
npm install promise
npm install request
npm install should

From there, navigate to the folder where you cloned to and edit the server.js. Uncomment the local testing port and comment out the proccess port (so you know where the websites being hosted). In terminal, start the node server with "node server.js"
